    ##Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
      To create a repository one must first log into your Github account. Second, you must click the + sign next to your username. Inside the repository form you must enter the name of your repository. You should make it public and then also set it to have an MIT license. After clicking the create repository button, you now have a created repository. In order to clone this repository copy the link next to "HTTPS clone URL." After this, open your terminal type in Git clone {link}. This will clone the repository into your local computer.

    ###Describe what open source means.
      Open source means allowing other people access to view and modify your code. Certain non-profit companies, such as Mozilla Firefox are open-source and feed of the vibrant community that the open source options offers, as anyone can be able to change and improve code for improved producitivity of everyone. Other for-profit companies choose to not be open source as once a code is open sourced, and a license is not in place, those companies no longer have the sole ownership of their code and thus their business.

    ####What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
      I love the idea of Open Source espeically in an enviornment that fosters creative thinking and ideas rather than discourage them. I do understand the reasons certain companies have for not being open-source, but I believe as licenses become more structured and innovative in the coming years, many of these companies will see the value an open-source community can bring to their company and seek to reap the benfits of the innovative and collaborative nature of the open source community.

    #####Assess the importance of using licenses.
      Licenses are extremely important in the increasingly collaborative and open world that we live in. While new ideas and innovative practices should certainly not be discouraged, there needs to be a structure in place to protect the original thinkers and rightful owners of the ideas. While many may think that licenses encourage a closed, uncollaborative community, I believe the opposite. I believe with strong licensing laws, innovators will be less nervous about sharing their code with others as they know they will be protected which will ultimately foster a more open, more collaborative environment.

    ######What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
      I believe that this challenge helped me solidify my understanding of how to create repositories, how to clone them, how to create files to put in them on my local computer, and then how to push those files back to my repositories on Github. I had one "aha" moment when I realized that while certain tasks can be daunting when you first look at them, after trying them out and messing up, you start to understand that you were actually learning the entire time. I learned more because of the mistakes that I made, and the frustrating moments that stemmed from my mistakes, than the times I had already understood something from the begenning which is very rewarding.

    #######Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
      I mostly used the resources that DBC provided as I thought the material was well organized and did not really need much outside help to understand the challenge.
