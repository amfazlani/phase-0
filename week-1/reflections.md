#1.1 Think About Time

    Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?

I learned about key practices and behaviors that can substantially increase your productivity and time management while also making the work that you do more fulfilling and increase your overall happiness. First, I found the pomodoro technique to be the most fascinating. The idea that working within 25 minute intervals in between breaks is a much more productive method than working a long period of time until the work is complete was surprising to me primarily because I was always taught that taking multiple breaks was a sign of laziness and lack of focus. But after learning different mediation techniques and how the brain works, it makes much more sense to me why taking breaks is vital. By taking breaks, your brain wanders less when working on the task at hand, thus increasing your overall productivity level. Second, I learned methods to keep myself "in the zone." While before I believed being "in the zone" was outside of a person's control and was a natural process, I have now learned like many other behaviors, being "in the zone" is something you can actually control. I have learned that we are most often distracted or "not in the zone" when we are faced with tasks that do not excite us. But in the article by Sarah Chang, it is shown that by making mundane or boring tasks more challenging, a person can avoid the natural tendencies of the brain to shut off, and thus be "in the zone" for longer periods of time.

    What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

"TIme Boxing" is the practice of assigning a set amount of time for a given amount of work and stopping the work when the set amount or "time box" has been reached. By stopping after the time box is reached, a person is allowed more time for reflection and has a better idea of how much work he/she has yet to complete.

    How do you manage your time currently?

Currently I manage my time solely based on the workload that I have and do not have set practices or behaviors in place to complete work. By reading these articles I have really found that the way I work is explicitly tied to the way I think and by changing the way I am managing my time currently, I can not only be more productive but find more fulfillment in my work, which is my ultimate goal.

    Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

I believe my strategy is working to certain extent. If the criteria was to complete the work assigned, then I would say my strategy is working. But if the criteria was to reach my highest productivity levels and reaching ultimate satisfaction for the work I complete, I would say my current strategy is definitely falling short. I believe this is primarily because your behavior and habits affect your brain in such substantial ways that unless you alter your behavior, it can be very hard to change the way you think or be more happy in the work you complete.

    Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?

Because each of these strategies have such outstanding benefits, it is easy for me to say I want to implement all of them. But implementation is much different than believing an idea works, it is making it a part of you and your daily activities.  My goal is to implement one strategy at a time and not move on to the other strategies until I have fully implanted the strategy I started with. For example, I want to start to meditate every day, as I believe it will greatly improve my productivity. Until I have reached the point where meditation has become part of my daily habit, I will not move onto the next technique I wish to implement, which is the pomodoro technique.

    What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

My overall plan for Phase 0 time management is separate the weekly tasks and challenges into bite-size pieces to complete throughout each day. As we have learned through Joel Gascoigne, the great thinkers and entrepreneurs have always started small, and my separating a "big" task such as completing the entire weeks assignments into smaller chunks, I will ultimately be not only more successful but also retain more information.

##1.2 The Command Line

    What is a shell? What is a "bash"?

A shell is an interface through which to communicate tasks to your computer. On Mac, this is also called a terminal. A "bash" is a language that is used to communicate commands to the computer through the shell.

    What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

It was considerably challenging going through the crash course and trying to understand the functionality of each command and the ways in which they are used. I think as I am able to memorize and use more commands on a daily basis, it will become easier for me to identify the different commands as well as learn more commands that may not have been included in the crash course.  Also, It was challenging grouping multiple commands together which I think will become easier as I learn to visualize what each command does and where I am in the terminal.

    Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

No, although I was able to successfully use most of the commands. I had a little trouble with redirection and pushd and popd so I will focus my attention on those as I move forward.

    In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

In my opinion, the most important navigational commands are ls,pwd, mkdir, cd, mdir as these are the primary commands to list, create and navigate through directories. I also feel the man command is very helpful to learn what each command does and how it is used.

    Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd- prints working directory

-ls- list directory that you are currently in.

-mv- moves file or directory

-cd- changes directory

-../-

-touch- makes empty file

-mkdir- makes directory

-less- allows you to view a file

-rmdir- removes directory

-rm- removes file

-help- provides information about commands. Also called the man command on Mac.

### 1.4 Create, Fork and Clone Repositories

    If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?

First, I would tell the person to log into his Github account. I would tell the person to click on the + sign next to his name. Once this person on the new repository page I would tell the person to type in the name of his new repository, make it public, and then set it to the MIT license. In order to fork a repo, I would instruct the person to go the repository he/she wishes to fork and then click the fork button which will automatically fork the repo to his account. In order to clone the repo I would tell that person to copy the HTTPS url that is embedded in the main page of the repository after it is forked and then navigate to his terminal. In the terminal the person must first navigate to the folder or directory that the repo needs to be cloned in and then type git clone and then paste the url. This will clone the repository. In some cases, it is more important to fork a repo than create a new one because you may want to build on or modify an already existing repository instead of starting completely from scratch.

    What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

It has actually been very smooth setting up git and GitHub although I must say I have not learned all of the git commands and will try to do that as soon as I can. I have learned though that much of coding is about setting up environments and  learning how to navigate through them. It my opinion, this skill is absolutely critical in the world of web development. It does make sense, though, that this is the case because of the collaborative nature of web development.
