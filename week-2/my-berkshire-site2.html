- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

  It was very rewarding to see an actual site that I was able to create and understand the thought process that went into creating the page each step of the way. As we progressed through the challenge I started being able to spot the tags that we needed for each detail of the site, from the bullet points, to the title, to the links. Also certain tags such as <p> and <a href> began to become natural as we progressed through making the website.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

  Researching and figuring out which tags we needed was not too difficult especially working with a pair. It seems that in HTML it is very easy to figure out exactly which tag you need for a specific task as long as you know what you are looking for. For me, it wsa difficult understanding the tags outside of the basic ones that were not required for this site, for example for tables, or tables within tables. But I believe as I learn more about HTML I will be able to identify those tags a lot easier.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

  We did a pretty good job with just following the instructions that were provided and understood that while the formatting of our page might be off, learning about CSS next week would fix a majority of those issues.

- What seems good and bad >bout HTML?

  What I like most about HTML is that it is very user friendly once you learn the basic fundamentals as it is organized in a very practical way. For example, every HTML page has a head and a body just like us humans! Also, I really liked how easy it was to incorporate images and text into the page as well as links.It is hard to say what is bad about HTML because I believe I only have a basic understanding of the fundamentals of the language and do not know the more complex tags and functions of HTML beyond what was used in this site. I would be able to speak more about the negatives of HTML as I learn more about both its pros and cons.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

  Certain tricks I have for remembering how to write HTML is memorizing the most basic tags such as <head>, <title>, <body>, and then visualizing which tags are most commonly used within those broader tags. For example with <body>, I know that <p> is a tag that will be used most often.
