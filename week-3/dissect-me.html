Git and Github: The Starting Point for Every Beginning Programmer </h1>
October 5, 2015
</section>

Git and Github are the starting point for every beginning programmer. In today's world of collaboration and "team coding" these platforms have become very popular and almost neccessary to learn to further your career in web development.Version control is the fundamental basis of both of these platforms. It is useful when you are working in an industry that constantly requries you to update, modify, change, or delete your work. Because web development certainly requires each of these tasks, version control has become a staple of the web development community. The benefits of version control are simple. It allows you to track your progress, save your previous work in case you need it later, and allows others to view and change your work without changing your original draft. But one must know that although Git and Github are both known as "version control" platforms, they are not the same.

Git allows you to track your changes through "commits." Commits are snapshots of your work at any given time or whenever your save your work. Because most successful developers commit "early and often," they are able to easily see the code they began with as well as the ways in which the code progressed. Because git is a software that you can only download to your computer, it is difficult to access remotely. Github allows you to access and modify your repositories as if you were working on your local computer. Second, Github is useful because it allows others to collaborate on your code and modify your code. Although you can collaborate on git as well, the collaborations are much easier and more convenient because of the remote capabilities of Github.

In conclusion, to understand the fundamentals of web development, one must first understand the fundamentals of version control and why it is useful. The innacurate depiction of web programmers working alone in their basement has certainly never been more untrue. Web programmers thrive off working with each other and modifying each other's code, especially in today's collaborative and open enviornment. For this reason, a solid understanding of version control platforms such as Git and Github have become essential for a succesful career in web development.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

We used all the basic tags that are included in an HTML skeleteon such as <p>, <h1>, etc. But the newer ones that I had not used before were <section>, <aside>, <article>,<meta charset="UTF-8">. We returned to these tags often because the bulk of the <body> is often made of certian common tags that are used again and again. <p> and <h1> is a great example of this.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
First, <!DOCTYPE html> must be used to tell the document that it is about to recieve HTML to display. Second <html> opens the actual html document. After this it is neccesary to have <head> and <body> with the latter showing everything that is actually displayed on the browser.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned that Sublime has alot of very cool features that can really make writing code alot easier. Now that I know how to create a snippet, I think it will be an invaluable tool as I move into more complex code as it could help to simplify the process a little more. Although, I have not researched any other shortcuts as of right now, that is something that I will definetely look into.
