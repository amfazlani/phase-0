# Concatenate Two Arrays

# I worked on this challenge [by myself].

#Psuedocode

#define a method called array_concat which takes in two parameters which are both arrays.
#add the two arrays so that they become one unified array.
#use the (+) sign which will add the two arrays and make them one array, similar to how strings are added.


# Your Solution Below

def array_concat(my_array1, my_array2)
    my_array1 + my_array2
end
